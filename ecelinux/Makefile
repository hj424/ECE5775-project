# @brief: A makefile the compiles and synthesizes the 3D rendering program
#
# @desc: 1. "make" runs csim by default
#        2. "make s" compliles & executes the top function - dut(rendering)
#        3. "make s1â€œ compiles & executes the first stage - projection
#        4. "make s2" compiles & executes the second stage - rasterization
#        5. "make s3" compiles & executes the third stage - zculling
#        6. "make clean" cleans up the direstory
